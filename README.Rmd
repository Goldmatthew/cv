This repository contains the files to create my academic CV using R Markdown. The project is completely inspired by the [`datadrivencv`](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) package using the `pagedown` package with the `html_resume` template. The CV is built using some custom functions that parse an online Google Sheets [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hVyK8LqC0c03antzkewx9K5sidw6Sfx5/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=100256278049849905450&rtpof=true&sd=true). To update my publications I use Paperpile and a custom Github action for keeping updated a `bib` file.

## Files

- `style/`: contains the default `resume.css` file with some extra tweaks
- `docs/`: contains the `html` and `pdf` versions of the CV
- `R/`: contains all the custom functions in order to create the CV
- `data/`: contains the downloaded Google Sheet file and the `bib` file
